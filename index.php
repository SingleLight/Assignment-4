                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Currently, I am a student at the University of Rochester majoring Biomedical Engineering with a concentration in Biosystems and Biosignals. As a biomedical engineering major, I became well versed in the field of engineering. I became exposed to situations and systems that I had never seen or analyzed before which allowed me to develop great problem solving and design skills. I also practiced delivering presentations and pitches to my peers and faculty members on projects such as the touch sensor and other research projects through which I learned how to convey complex ideas in an interactive and engaging way for a wide range of audiences. </p>

                <h2>Before College</h2>
                <p>Throughout the years I've always enjoyed math as well as science. Ever since I was approximately five years old, I always had a passion for math. This was probably due to the fact that I found the subject amusing and easy. Over the years the definition of "math" changed for me. This was especially apparent when I transitioned form middle school math classes to TBLS math classes. In middle math was only about solving equation and working independently but in TBLS it became more about learning the concept and working as a group to expand our capabilities. I think math is very valuable because with an understanding of math you can see theworld in a very logical and understandable manner because u know why things are the way they are; for example why a bridge doesn't collapse or why we can build building that is hundreds of feet high. If there is something in math I struggle in is remembering equations because there are so many it can at times be confusing but other than that I do well in other areas. Topics in math that I enjoy are the topics that explain things we see every day and help you understand the worldthat surrounds you. I enjoy these things because it helps you see the world in a new light that makes sense.</p>

        <h2>School/Internships</h2>

        <p>While at school, I have obtained knowledge in mechanical, electrical, material, and software engineering while learning how to utilize programs like Excel, HTML, MATLAB, CAD, CSS, JavaScript and OrCAD. Due to my major, most of my work is in research.</p>

        <p>My research and projects include an Ultrasound Probe Mount where I worked with 3 other engineering students to design and manufacture a mount for an ultrasound probe designed by Sonavex, Inc. The mount aimed to allow sonographers to perform continuous B-mode scanning for 30 minutes to detect thrombosis after free flap surgery. We used tools and methods such as CAD, 3D printers, and Lean Six Sigma to aid with creating the best possible design. Another project was a rehabilitation MATLAB GUI where we used MATLAB to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that aimed to help patients rehabilitate from spinal cord injuries. The program was interactive and encouraged the patients to practice motor skills that would have been lost due to the injuries. Lastly, I worked on a touch sensor. I Created a circuit that delivers the sensation of touch to a patient with no fingers using variable capacitors, 555 timer chips and knowledge of circuits. Modeled the circuit using OrCAD. I helped create a final soldered version to be placed on a 3D-printed prosthetic hand.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of the classroom, I enjoy various activities. I am a member of a music collective that promotes local artists and musicians using our mission and outreach. I enjoy managing my stock portfolio, which is worth approximately 6,000 dollars. I also enjoy traveling and have been to countries like Costa Rica, Switzerland, and Italy.</p>
