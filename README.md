## Readability

I changed the color of the text to black to make them stand out from the backgroud and easier to read.

I left the headings' color intact as they are larger and easier to read in the first place and the two colors look quite harmonous together.

I changed the line spacing to 1.7 times to make it easier to track lines.



## Typography

I used Laila as my header fonts, as it is curvy and upright, giving us a pleasant and cheerful feeling, which is exactly what you want people to feel looking at your (CV-ish) website.

I used Raleway as my paragraph fonts. Because first google fonts think it's a good pair with my Laila headers, and it's a lot more blocky and skinner than the default one, giving out a more dilligent mood apporopriate for academic contents.
